# CZE_maps


Script and data to create maps of population distribution and population density of settlements in Czech Republic

First is needed to have all following files in folder: OBCE_P.dbf, OBCE_P.prj, OBCE_P.shp, OBCE_P.shx and data.csv (extracted from data.zip). 
If you don't have "data.csv", you'll need to have folder "Obce_obyvatele" and "obyvatele_plocha.csv" and you'll need 
to run script "data_create.py" - please note that it takes hours/days to complete this script. Result is "data.csv" file.

When you have all needed files you can run script "mapy.py" - unfortunately script inputs are decribed in czech only.

After you'll put in which data and how you want to display them, tha map is created and shown.
